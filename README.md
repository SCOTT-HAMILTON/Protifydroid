## About
Protify lets you choose long-running processes on your computer and it will watch them for you. And you'll receive a notification on you android mobile phone each time one of them has terminated.

## How does it work
To work with your computer, use the [Protify desktop app](https://github.com/SCOTT-HAMILTON/Protify). Protifydroid will only work if both your mobile and your computer are connected to the same local network such has your home's wifi. It uses mDNS under the hood.

## Building
Protify is configured with Android Studio

## License
Protify is released under the well known [MIT License](https://scott-hamilton.mit-license.org/)
